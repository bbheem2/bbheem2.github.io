I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advised by Karrie Karahalios in the Social Spaces group. My research sits at the intersection of algorithmic justice, public-sector AI policy, and human-computer interaction, focusing on:

  1. Leveraging computational methods and justice-centered frameworks to analyze bias and discrimination in sociotechnical systems.
  2. Evaluating and advocating for policy and governance structures as critical tools to ensure AI systems uphold digital, human, and civil rights.

My work is driven by the goal of empowering communities and stakeholders to audit, contest, influence, and resist the deployment of AI technologies, ensuring accountability, fairness, and equity.
